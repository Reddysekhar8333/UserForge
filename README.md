# UserForge

Plan a distributed setup for a Django application with the following components:

Web Server (Nginx)

Application Server (Gunicorn/Uvicorn)

Caching Layer (Redis)

Database (PostgreSQL)

Search Engine (Elasticsearch)

# Requirements:

Security:

* HTTPS/TLS encryption

* Secure API endpoints (JWT/OAuth)

* Regular security patches

Scalability:

* Horizontal scaling for Django workers

* Database read replicas

* Load balancing

Cost-Effectiveness:

* Use managed services (e.g., AWS RDS, Elasticache)

* Auto-scaling based on traffic

* Spot instances for non-critical components
